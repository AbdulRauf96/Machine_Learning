# Machine_Learning

This repository contains basics for Machine Learning studied during UTD and showcases an understanding of core concepts needed to create working models and fine-tune them. Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

The broad areas of Machine Learning are:

* Supervised Learning
* Semi-Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data. The training data consist of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a "reasonable" way (see inductive bias).

### Types of Supervised Learning

Under the umbrella of supervised learning, there are two main types of learning algorithms:

#### Classification

Classification is a supervised learning approach in which the computer program learns from the data input given to it and is then able to predict the class of the unlabeled data points. Classification is a predictive modeling problem where a computer program learns from the data input given to it and is then able to predict the class of the unlabeled data points. Classification is a predictive modeling problem where a computer program learns from the data input given to it and is then able to predict the class of the unlabeled data points. Classification is a predictive modeling problem where a computer program learns from the data input given to it and is then able to predict the class of the unlabeled data points.

The following are some of the classification algorithms:

1. K-Nearest Neighbors
2. Decision Trees
3. Logistic Regression
4. Naive Bayes
5. Support Vector Machines

#### Regression

Regression is a supervised learning approach in which the computer program learns from the data input given to it and is then able to predict the output for the unlabeled data points. Regression is a predictive modeling problem where a computer program learns from the data input given to it and is then able to predict the output for the unlabeled data points. Regression is a predictive modeling problem where a computer program learns from the data input given to it and is then able to predict the output for the unlabeled data points.
